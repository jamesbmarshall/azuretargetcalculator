    <h3>Design &amp; Hosting</h3>

    <p>This site is written in a mix of PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and was created using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. Source code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/jamesbmarshall/azuretargetcalculator">GitHub</a>
    , connected to Azure App Service for deployment automatically. Clearly, I'm not a designer! I do always appreciate feedback, so feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesbmarshall">tweet</a> 
or <a href="https://mstdn.social/@jamesbmarshall">toot</a> at me with your thoughts!</p>
    
    <p>I'm using a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/app-service/linux/">B1 basic App Service plan</a> because it means I don't have to worry about the overheads of spinning up my own hosting stack just for a 
        couple of simple web pages!</p>
